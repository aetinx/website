If you want a commission, you can send me an email at [hello@aetinx.dev](mailto:hello@aetinx.dev), or message me on a platform that I'm active on, like Discord.

Branding commissions currently start at the amazing price of $500 USD<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>.
  
<small>All commissions are subject to the [Aetinx Commissions Agreement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRe-ek54UQT83f4Qhf2GgAw7EhrEQq-rWKX3sWzX_YICS0Z_foVyqE8RgmJdopdeUNETVtJaynSL-Tv/pub).</small>

<small><sup id="fn1">1</sup>Exceptions and/or discounts may apply.</small>

Currently I can only take payments via these gift cards<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> that can be sent to hello@aetinx.dev:
* [Vanilla Gift](https://www.vanillagift.com/blue-leaves-email)
* [Amazon](https://amazon.com/dp/B004LLIKVU)
