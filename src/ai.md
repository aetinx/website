For some of my coding and writing projects, I’ve decided to use OpenAI’s GPT models to help assist me. This AI helps me brainstorm new ideas, summarise material and write better sentences. It’s a great help for letting me streamline my work and create better content — especially in things like accessibility issues and HTML semantics.

Additionally, I use the GPT models to  help assist me with fixing and completing JavaScript code, especially when it comes to learning new APIs, frameworks and other technologies.

When I use AI generation, the purpose is to enhance my own work, not create it for me. Every piece of generated content that is used is reviewed and tweaked to my own liking and taste.
